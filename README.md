## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

In this project, I will use the detailed listing dataset provided by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for North Carolina, USA. The dataset contains 2K observations with over 70 attributes. Some of the attributes used in the analysis are price(continuous), longitude (continuous), latitude (continuous), listing_type (categorical), is_superhost (categorical), neighbourhood (categorical), review ratings (continuous) among others.
According to the website, the data was collected in April, 2021 which was scraped from Airbnb website.
I would like to explore the data by analysing the factors which influence the prices/rentals. For example, it will be interesting to visualize the data by ploting a heatmap of location against demand as well as the word cloud of customer reviews. Besides visualization, I would like to conduct a demand and price analysis for Airbnb rentals by building regression models.
