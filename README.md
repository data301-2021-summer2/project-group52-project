## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
Airbnb has seen a meteoric growth since its inception in 2008 with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year. Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more travellers, not just the ones who are looking for a bang for their buck but also business travellers resort to Airbnb as their premier accommodation provider. In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis of the Airbnb dataset sourced from the Inside Airbnb website to understand the rental landscape in NC, USA through various static and interactive visualisations.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

In this project, I will use the detailed listing dataset provided by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for North Carolina, USA. The dataset contains 2K observations with over 70 attributes. Some of the attributes used in the analysis are price(continuous), longitude (continuous), latitude (continuous), listing_type (categorical), is_superhost (categorical), neighbourhood (categorical), review ratings (continuous) among others.
According to the website, the data was collected in April, 2021 which was scraped from Airbnb website.
I would like to explore the data by analysing the factors which influence the prices/rentals. For example, it will be interesting to visualize the data by ploting a heatmap of location against demand as well as the word cloud of customer reviews. Besides visualization, I would like to conduct a demand and price analysis for Airbnb rentals by building regression models.
