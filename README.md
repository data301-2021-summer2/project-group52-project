## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

In this project, I will use the detailed listing dataset provided by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for North Carolina, USA. The dataset contains 2K observations with over 70 attributes. Some of the attributes used in the analysis are price(continuous), longitude (continuous), latitude (continuous), listing_type (categorical), is_superhost (categorical), neighbourhood (categorical), review ratings (continuous) among others.
